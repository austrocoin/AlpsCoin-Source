# AlpsCoin-qt

In times of politicans going totally crazy and restrict the freedom of people living years in friendship by closing open boarders for their populism I wanted to try getting people more knowledge around cryptocurrencies. Getting people back a little freedom they were already used to have and privacy in times of rushing in a reverse trend of fully transparent people & secret governments.

What I learned is teaching people with the huge market-cap coins is only frighten the starterts from learning using cryptocurrency. Thats why I setup a Scrypt POW / POS coin for practicing people. Stacking return is 5% - so we have already a huge bonus compared to our banks!

Who like the idea that I get people teached cryptocurrency via AlpsCoin can support (and help pay seeds via BTC):
[BTC-address]

Maybe it will reach some value - who know :-)
